Machine learning (ML) is a branch of and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

Artificial intelligence or AI, the broadest term of the three, is used to classify machines that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning.
Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows for optimization. When set up correctly, it helps you make predictions that minimize the errors that arise from merely guessing. 
Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required

Why Deep Learning ?????? --> Inspired by Biology
Features is created by itself rather than providing the features

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised machine learning  --> Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

a. Regression --> If output/target data value is numerical
b. Classification --> If the target data value is categorical

2. Unsupervised machine learning --> Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters).

a. Clustering --> Grouping of unlabeled data
b. Dimension Reduction --> Reducing the number of features or combining two features --> PCA
c. Anamoly Detection --> Detecting the exceptions
d. Association Rule based Learning --> Finding relationship between two features Eg--> Walmart Beer adn Dipers

3. Semi-supervised learning --> Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning labeling the unlabeled data using labeled data

4. Reinforcement machine learning --> Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isnâ€™t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. 
Eg --> Self Driving Car

BATCH ML --> Training the model Offline 
[ Data --> Model --> Test --> Server ]
Disadvantages --> Lots of data , Hardware Limitation

ONLINE ML --> Training the model Online
[ Data --> Model --> Test --> Server <-- Real time Data]
