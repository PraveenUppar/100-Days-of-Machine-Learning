TENSORS ????? --> It is a data structure

1. 0D TENSORS --> 0 Dimension array

2. 1D TENSORS --> It is a vector and the number of elements is the Dimension
                  The Dimension of 1D TENSORS is 1 but the Dimension vector is the number of elements

3. 2D TENSORS --> Multiple Vectors combined makes matrix 

4. ND TENSORS --> n Dimension array




Eg of 3D TENSORS --> NLP
Eg of 4D TENSORS --> Image Processing
Eg of 5D TENSORS --> Video Processing
